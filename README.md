# Roblox-New-User-Milestone-Tracker
Constantly sends Get requests to see whether a user exists yet. If it does then it moves on to the next ID and repeats that until it exists. 

### Steps
1. Download the script
2. Change the `Delta` parameter if you wish to see every `N` user instead of the default which is every `100`th user.
3. Run the script via node. `node Index.js`
